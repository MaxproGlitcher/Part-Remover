# Part-Deletor
Part Deletor is a Roblox exploit that allows players to delete any baseparts locally in a Roblox game.

# How to use:

2) Toggle the UI status
3) Hover the desired basepart that you want to delete
4) Press "X" (or whatever you set as the Delete Key) on a keyboard.

Video: Coming Soon!

Unfortunately, mobile devices are not supported for this exploit.

# Features:
1) Status - On/Off switch for the hack
2) Notifications - On/Off switch for notifications
3) Toggle UI - Editable keybind to hide and show the UI
4) Delete key - Input that deletes the desired part
5) Toggle status - Input that turns the hack on/off

Note: If HttpGet fails, try injecting the RAW script (though won't auto update).
